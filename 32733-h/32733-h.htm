<br />

<p>John Leonard Hardenbergh, the author of the following Journal, was a
native of Rosendale, Ulster County, in the Province of New York, born
in the year 1748. He was the son of Leonard and Rachel Hardenbergh,
and the youngest of seven children. The family name is one of the
oldest in the State, and is prominent both in its colonial and
revolutionary annals. As early as 1644, Arnoldus van Hardenbergh a
"free merchant" emigrated from Holland to New Amsterdam "with a cargo
of wares for sale in the colony." He was soon after selected as one of
the original Nine Men of New Netherland, and served in this board from
1647 to 1650.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He was followed in, or about, the year 1652, by his
brother Johannes van Hardenbergh, also a merchant from Amsterdam, who
at this date was purchaser of "a house, lot and garden" on Manhattan
Island. (Calendar, Hist. MSS. in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>office of the Secretary of State,
Albany, Part I, vol. iii).</p>

<p>The branch of the family that was subsequently settled at Rosendale,
is traced to the year 1706, when Johannes Hardenbergh, with six
others, obtained from the crown of Great Britain a grant of land which
comprised, as computed at the time, 1,500,000 acres, located in
Northern Ulster, then including a portion of the present county of
Sullivan,&mdash;the western boundary extending to, or near the head of, the
Delaware river. The terminal syllable of the name, <i>bergh</i>, indicates
that the earlier ancestors in Holland were from the hills; and it was
quite natural that their descendants should have found permanent
location in the hilly districts of Shendaken and Shawangunk,
stretching westward from the valley of the Hudson; neither is it
surprising that they should have loved freedom and have given their
best efforts for its establishment in their adopted land.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the Revolution, Col. Johannes Hardenbergh, Jr. was
placed at the head of the Committee of Safety for Ulster
County&mdash;Kingston, its chief town, being at the time the seat of the
New York Provincial Congress of which he was also a member. He had
ranked as Colonel in the English colonial service, and been active in
military affairs as early as 1748, when Sir William Johnson was in
command of the New York troops for the defence of the frontier against
the French and Indians. He was also given command by the Provincial
Congress of one of the earliest regiments raised for the immediate
defence of the Hudson above the Highlands, at the opening of the war
of Independence, and from his experience and position was enabled to
render distinguished service at that critical period. In 1786, three
years after the return of peace, he removed from his farm in Rosendale
to New Brunswick, N.J., to spend the remnant of his days with his son,
Rev. Dr. Jacob R. Hardenbergh, the first President of Rutger's
College.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Leonard Hardenbergh, a younger brother of Col. Johannes, Jr., and the
father of the subject of this sketch, died July 7, 1776, only three
days after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and as his
neighbors of the hardy yeomanry of Ulster, were leaving their harvests
ungathered and marching to the defence of Fort Montgomery, one of the
principal fortifications guarding the passes of the Hudson. In the
official returns for the same month (July) the name of John L.
Hardenbergh appears as First Lieutenant in the Second New York Militia
under command of Col. Morris Graham, and assigned to the Brigade of
Gen. George Clinton, who had remained in the Continental Congress to
vote for the Declaration, when he hastened home to his command. Having
served several months in this regiment raised under special call,
Hardenbergh was commissioned Nov. 21, 1776, First Lieutenant in the
Second New York Continental Regiment, under Col. Rudolphus Ritzema,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
who was superseded Nov. 30, 1776, by the appointment of Col. Philip
Van Courtlandt, a gallant officer and a personal friend of Washington
whose confidence he shared to an unusual degree.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The regiment had
the previous month been in the battle of White Plains, under
Lieutenant-Col. Weissenfels, where it did some hard fighting; and was
ordered by Washington to Fishkill for the winter, to be recruited and
disciplined, and thus ready for active service in the Spring. But few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>enlistments, however, were obtained, though several recruiting parties
were sent out for the purpose; and in the Spring of 1777, it was
ordered to Peekskill, a point for the collection of military stores,
and where at this time large quantities had been gathered under
protection of General McDougall's brigade. Soon after, a fleet of ten
British ships or transports appeared in Peekskill Bay, and landed a
force of five hundred men with four pieces of artillery, which
compelled Gen. McDougall, who had scarcely half that number of troops,
to retreat to Gallows Hill, about ten miles in the rear, leaving what
stores could not be removed, in the hands of the enemy, who remained
in possession of the town until McDougall was reinforced, when they
retired to their ships and returned to New York.</p>

<p>After several weeks of hard and perilous service, Col. Van Courtlandt
with his regiment, was ordered to Albany and thence to the relief of
Fort Stanwix, then besieged by Colonel St. Leger with a party of
Indians; but on information that the enemy had retired, he joined
General Poor, then on the advance to Stillwater, to whose brigade the
regiment became attached, and thus made a part of General Arnold's
command, forming a portion of the left wing in the first battle of
Stillwater, which was fought on the 19th of September. The loss of
killed and wounded of the Second New York was two out of eleven, which
was a larger proportion than of any other regiment engaged, the next
largest being that of Col. Cilley's First New Hampshire, which was one
out of seven, all of General Poor's Brigade.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At the second battle,
which occurred on the 7th of October, the regiment sustained its
reputation for determined bravery and hard fighting, and thus bore an
honorable part in the most important engagement, thus far, of the war,
the results of which changed the whole aspect of the American cause.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>After the battle of Stillwater, which compelled the surrender of
Burgoyne, and rendered fruitless the previous successes of the enemy
along the Hudson, the regiment returned to Fishkill, and soon joined
the army under Washington, then confronted by the British forces under
General Howe, in the vicinity of Philadelphia. It shared the
privations and sufferings of the terrible winter encampment at Valley
Forge, (1777-8) the march to which of the half naked, half-starved,
shoeless army might be tracked in blood through the December snows. It
appears from an orderly book<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> found among the papers of Colonel,
afterwards Gen. Henry Dearborn, also in the Sullivan expedition, that
at Valley Forge, Hardenbergh was Lieutenant and Adjutant of his
regiment and often served as Adjutant of the Day at Head Quarters. The
whole encampment consisted of about eleven thousand troops; and when
it was broken up the following Spring, upwards of three thousand men
unfit for duty were left behind, under charge of Colonel Van
Courtlandt, while his regiment proceeded with the main army, and
participated in the battle of Monmouth, June 28, 1778, winning
commendation for bravery and good behavior in that hotly contested
engagement.</p>

<p>While at camp with the main army at White Plains the same season, the
Second New York Regiment was sent to guard the frontiers in Ulster
County against the depredations of the Indians under Brant, who had
already destroyed several houses and murdered men, women and children.
It remained in the neighborhood of Laghawack, on this duty, during the
winter of 1778-79; and in the Spring while on the march to surprise
Brant stationed on the Delaware with about one hundred and fifty
Indians, an express from General Washington overtook the regiment with
orders to proceed to Fort Penn, there to await orders from General
Sullivan. It is at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>this point that the Journal of Lieutenant
Hardenbergh, herewith published, dates.</p>

<p>On its return from the Expedition, the regiment proceeded to Easton,
Pennsylvania, and from thence to Morristown, N.J., where it was hutted
for the winter. In the spring of 1780 it was sent to Fort Edward for
temporary service, and in June proceeded to West Point, and in
expectation of an attack from the enemy, was posted on the mountain
west of Fort Putnam. This proved, however, to be a feint to cover an
invasion of the Jerseys. During the treason of Arnold the regiment was
at Tappan, whither Andre was taken after his capture, and where he was
tried and executed.</p>

<p>From the autumn of 1776 to the winter of 1780, Lieutenant Hardenbergh
was identified with the Second New York, sharing its fortunes, and
participating in the important battles in which it was engaged, when
the five New York regiments were consolidated into two, in which
arrangement he fell into that class of officers who were retained in
service but not attached to any battalion. But in July 1782 he was
made Captain of Levies under Lieut. Col. Weissenfels, in which
capacity he continued for the remainder of the war.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1781, he is accredited in the chronicles of the time,
with a daring exploit, which indicates the kind of service in which he
was engaged after he ceased to be attached to the Second New York. A
body of three hundred Indians and ninety Tories under Captain
Cauldwell, an officer in Butler's Rangers, appeared on the frontier of
Ulster County, in the neighborhood of Warwasing, having passed
unobserved the stockade forts at the north of Lackawaxen and
Neversink, expecting to surprise the settlements and repeat the scenes
of massacre which had desolated other regions in the vicinity. Captain
Hardenbergh, at the time, was stationed with a guard of nine<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> men,
near the house of J.G. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Hardenbergh,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and at a point some three
miles distant from a small fortress at Warwasing. As the enemy passed
the fort just before the break of day they were fired upon by the
sentinel. The report alarmed Captain Hardenbergh, who with his little
band proceeded immediately in direction of the sound, and on his way
met the enemy directing their course toward the settlement, which is
now called Rochester. Nothing daunted he gave them battle; but being
closely pressed he soon discovered that his retreat was cut off by a
party of Indians who had gained his rear. In this dilemma the Captain
resorted to stratagem which admirably answered the purpose. It was as
yet barely light, and turning aside in the woods with the little
company, to conceal the smallness of his force, he took off his hat
and huzzaed with all his might, at the same time advancing toward a
small stone house near by, and in face of the Indians, who supposing
that the troops were coming up from Pinebush, took the alarm and
skulked off in every direction. But no sooner had Hardenbergh and his
company reached the house, when the Indians discovering the ruse,
poured a shower of bullets after them just as they were safely within
the door. Here they found six militia men besides, making sixteen in
all, and being well armed, made all preparations to hold their
position against the invaders. With an ax they broke a series of
loop-holes in the rear of the house and through the sides of the steep
roof, thus commanding its approaches on all sides. The enemy advanced
several times to carry the house by assault, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>but as some of their
number were doomed to fall at every onset, they as often gave way, and
at length were compelled to relinquish the attack, leaving thirteen
dead upon the field. In the meanwhile the firing had aroused the
neighborhood, and Col. Henry Pawling with a detachment of State
Levies, stationed about six miles from the scene of action, hastened
forward, but arrived too late to have a brush with the enemy, and only
in season to capture a straggler, who had lingered for fruit, near an
apple orchard. Cauldwell was in full retreat, and though pursued by
Colonel Pawling with his regiment of Levies and Colonel Cantine with a
regiment of State Militia, for some days, finally escaped. The enemy,
however, suffered severely and besides losing a number of men, were so
near starvation that they were obliged to eat their dogs before they
reached Niagara, the point from which they had started on their errand
of pillage and murder. This was the last attempt of the kind made upon
the frontier settlements, which had suffered so severely from repeated
invasions of Indians and Tories during the Revolution. It was designed
to be a finishing blow upon that region, and as we have seen, it was
largely due to the bravery and military tact of Captain Hardenbergh
that the stroke was averted.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>At the close of the war, during the entire period of which he had been
in active service, he returned to his native place, to share the
fruits of Independence with peace, which he had done so much to
secure. He had justly acquired the reputation of a brave and skillful
officer, and his name still appears on the Roll of Honor in the
cabinet of Revolutionary memorials kept at Washington's Head-Quarters
at Newburgh. He was for a time on Washington's staff; and his whole
record is that of a devoted patriot and a faithful <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>soldier, at a time
when the country needed every heart and hand for its defence.</p>

<p>In 1789, the Indian titles to most of the lands in the State of New
York, having been extinguished, the Legislature provided for the
survey of a certain portion of these lands, already set apart for the
soldiers of the State, who had served in the war of the Revolution.
This tract embracing 1,680,000 acres, and denominated the Military
Tract, included the present counties of Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and
Cortland, also the larger part of Tompkins with portions of Oswego and
Wayne. It was surveyed into twenty-eight townships, containing each
one hundred lots of six hundred acres. Each private soldier and
non-commissioned officer had one lot assigned him. The officers
received larger shares in proportion to their rank. Colonel
Hardenbergh was appointed on this survey, in immediate association
with Moses Dewitt, brother of Simeon Dewitt, at the time
Surveyor-General of the State, and was occupied in this work during
the years 1789-90. His field books, neatly kept and carefully
preserved, are now in possession of the Cayuga County Historical
Society, one of several valuable donations from the family to the
Society's archives. The lands which fell to him on the assignment of
military bounties, were located in Onondaga, disposing of which, he
purchased lot Forty-Seven, within the present limits of Auburn, from
Ogden and Josiah Hoffman, and originally patented to Captain Thomas
Doughty also of the Second New York. The deed bears date Feb. 16,
1792, and the consideration was one hundred and eighty pounds N.Y.
currency. Colonel Hardenbergh was familiar as a surveyor with its
comparative advantages, for a settlement, and especially with its
superior water power, and had already indicated the lot on his map of
survey as a "good mill site." He came on to his lands the same year
(1792) bringing with him several negro slaves, and built a bark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>shelter near the site of the present Hardenbergh mansion, and on the
spot where the City Hall now stands. He made a visit in the fall or
winter of that year, to Rosendale and was united in marriage to Mary
Bevier, also of one of the most substantial and prominent families of
that part of the State, and soon after returned to make further
preparations for a permanent home. This year also he received a
commission as Major in the Battalion of Herkimer County, having
previously been appointed a Captain in a Battalion for Montgomery,
which until 1791 included the counties of Herkimer and Tioga. He was
also appointed, in 1793, by Governor George Clinton, his old Brigade
commander on the Hudson in the beginning of the war, an Associate
Justice for Herkimer County, and designated the same year as one of
the three Commissioners to lay out and construct the Genesee Turnpike.
His last military promotion was that of Lieutenant Colonel of a
regiment of Militia in Onondaga County, in April, 1796, by Governor
John Jay, and gave him the title of Colonel, by which he is most
commonly known in the early annals of Auburn.</p>

<p>In 1794 he had completed a saw and grist mill, on the Owasco Outlet,
near where the Stone Mill now stands, opposite the junction of Genesee
and Market Streets, thus forming the nucleus of a settlement known as
Hardenbergh's Corners until 1805, when it took the name of Auburn.</p>

<p>The death of his wife occurred in the Spring, a little more than a
year after their marriage, leaving an infant daughter, and before his
arrangements were complete for bringing them to their new home in the
wilderness.</p>

<p>In 1795 a colony of ten families from Gettysburgh, Pa., made a
settlement about three miles up the Owasco Lake, and at once organized
a Reformed Protestant Dutch Church, which subsequently took corporate
form and title, Sept. 23, 1796, at a meeting held at the house of
Colonel <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Hardenbergh, who identified himself with this society in the
faith and order of which he had been educated. His copy of the New
Testament with the Psalms in a single volume, and in the Dutch
language, is still preserved; and bearing on the fly-leaf, under his
own signature, the same date with that of his first army commission,
it shows the signs of ordinary use not only, but the unmistakable
marks of the exposure and hardships incident to a soldier's life.</p>

<p>His second marriage, in 1796, was with Martina, daughter of R&oelig;liff
Brinkerhoff, one of the first deacons of the Owasco church, and the
names of his two children by this marriage, Maria and John Herring,
appear on the baptismal register of that church for the years 1798 and
1800. The only son, John H. Hardenbergh, was in subsequent years one
of Auburn's most prominent and public spirited citizens. As the heir
to the landed estate of his father, originally covering a large
section of the territory now occupied by the city, his wise and
generous policy toward purchasers of lots and tenants, contributed
much to its growth and prosperity. The lot, in the centre of the city,
on which stands the First Presbyterian church, one of the most
substantial and elegant structures of the kind in the State, if not in
the country, was his gift, before he had become of age; as were also
eight acres of land comprised in the spacious grounds occupied by the
Auburn Theological Seminary. These and similar deeds of generous
foresight, together with an amiable character and a blameless
Christian life, preserve in esteem and honor the name so closely
identified with the origin of our favored city.</p>

<p>Colonel Hardenbergh died after a brief illness, on the 25th of April,
1806, in the 59th year of his age, and was buried with military honors
in the North Street Cemetery. The Rev. David Higgins, then pastor of
the Congregational Church of Aurelius, and the founder of the First
Presbyterian Church of Auburn, preached the funeral sermon from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>the
Epistle to the Philippians, iii; 20, 21: <i>For our conversation is in
heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus
Christ, who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like
unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able
even to subdue all things unto himself.</i> The horse bearing the sword
and uniform of the deceased officer, was led by Harry Freeman, one of
the Colonel's slaves to whom he had given his freedom. A long
procession of military and citizens followed the remains to the grave.
The whole scene was imposing, as a sincere tribute of the respect and
esteem cherished for the man who had braved the perils of the then
recent struggle for national independence, and with generous hand had
laid the foundations, in the wilderness, of a well-ordered community.
He had passed thirty years of his life as a soldier, a surveyor, and a
pioneer settler, and had occupied the most responsible trusts in the
rising settlement which owed to him its origin. He was moreover a
great favorite with his fellow pioneers, and with all who were seeking
new homes in the immediate vicinity, ambitious rather for the thrift
of the place than for personal gains, or the promotion of selfish
ends&mdash;forward and generous in all plans to establish religion,
education, justice and good order, with whatever tended to the
permanent prosperity and true character of the infant settlement. He
was not always careful of his own interests, and was sometimes imposed
upon by those in whom he confided as if they were as trustworthy as
himself. If a neighbor wanted a bushel or two of grain, he might be
trusted to measure it himself and render his own account. In this way
and in others characteristic of him, he doubtless now and then lost
pecuniarily, but they gave him a strong hold upon the better and
larger class of his co-pioneers, and a leading influence at this
forming period in our history. Indeed, Auburn owes very much to the
spirit, foresight and enterprise of its founder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>In person, Colonel Hardenbergh was tall, of swarthy complexion, robust
frame, and is said to have been a most commanding figure on horseback,
in his regimentals, on military occasions. He took an active part in
the politics of the day, and was decided and open in the expression of
his opinions. He was a warm friend and ardent supporter of Governor
George Clinton, under whom he had served in the first year of the war,
and whose confidence he largely shared in the distribution of military
promotions and civil appointments. A sturdy patriot, a brave soldier,
a civilian, honored and trusted in public station and in private life,
he has fairly won the gratitude with which communities are wont to
remember their founders.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION TO JOURNALS.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>The following is printed from the original manuscript, in possession
of the family, in the hand-writing of Lieutenant Hardenbergh,
undoubtedly an original journal made by him during the campaign of
General Sullivan against the Indians.</p>

<p>The route covered by the Journal, begins at Wawarsing, in Ulster
County, New York, passing south-westerly along the Mine road and
Delaware river to Stroudsburg, Penn.; thence westerly over the
mountains, by the Sullivan road to Wilkesbarre; thence up the
Susquehanna river to Tioga Point near present Athens, where General
Clinton's brigade on August 22d, joined the main army; thence up the
Chemung river to present Elmira, and northerly to Havana; thence along
the east shore of Seneca lake to present Geneva, and by way of
Canandaigua, Honeoye, and Conesus to the Genesee river near present
Cuylerville, in Livingston county, where was found the great Seneca
town of Chenandoanes, or Genesee Castle, the most westerly point
reached by the expedition.</p>

<p>The return was over nearly the same route to Easton, and thence up the
Delaware to Morristown, N.J., where the regiment went into winter
quarters.</p>

<p>In addition to Lieutenant Hardenbergh's journal, will be found that
part of the journal of Major Erkuries Beatty, which relates to the
march of General Clinton's brigade from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>the valley of the Mohawk,
down the Susquehanna river to join General Sullivan at Tioga Point.</p>

<p>On the return march, Sept. 20th, when the army reached Kanadasega, an
Indian town near present Geneva, Lieutenant Colonel William Butler
commanding the Fourth Pennsylvania regiment, was detached with six
hundred men, with orders to proceed around the north end of Cayuga
lake, and devastate the Indian settlements on the east side. Thomas
Grant accompanied this detachment; that portion of his journal which
relates to the operations of this force, is also presented.</p>

<p>On the next day, September 21st, Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Dearborn
commanding the third New Hampshire regiment, with two hundred and
fifty men, was detached to proceed along the west shore of Cayuga lake
to complete the destruction in that quarter. That part of Colonel
Dearborn's journal describing his operations on this march, also
appears. The journals of Lieutenant Hardenbergh, Major Beatty and
Colonel Dearborn, have not hitherto appeared in print.</p>

<p>Notes have been added mostly from cotemporary writers illustrating the
text, and giving descriptions of events and places mentioned, also
introducing, at the proper place, descriptions of important matters
referred to and described in other journals, but not appearing in any
of the preceding.</p>

<p>Especial attention has been given to the descriptions of Indian towns,
and it is confidently believed, that here for the first time, can be
found, at least, an approximation to a complete list, and the exact
location of the entire number destroyed. The descriptions in nearly
all cases are from personal knowledge obtained by actual survey; the
evidences of aboriginal occupation being plainly apparent.</p>

<p>The maps and descriptions of the battle field of Newtown, and of the
Groveland ambuscade, it is believed will be an important addition to
the literature of the campaign, and a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>valuable aid to those engaged
in its study; and will present a more correct description of these
important matters than has hitherto appeared in print. The conclusions
reached, are the result of a most patient examination of all
authorities accessible, and will be likely to stand the test of the
most intelligent and critical scrutiny. The list of journals and
narratives relating to this campaign, though not as perfect as might
be desired, will be found useful to those who wish to obtain authentic
sources of information, and undoubtedly, many will be surprised to
learn that so much original material is in existence and accessible.</p>

<p>The text of the several journals, has been followed literally, from
the original manuscript when possible. Proper names, especially those
of Indian towns, even in the same manuscript, are often found with
material variations in spelling, and in many instances, different
authors give entirely different names for the same place; in other
cases wrong names are applied, and frequently are transposed. The
great Seneca town, on the Genesee river, is honored with several
distinct names, one of which has seventy variations in spelling; and
Appletown has three distinct locations, several miles distant from
each other. Care has been taken, to avoid confusion as much as
possible, by explanations in the notes, and in the use of names most
in accord with those in modern use.</p>

drum-head, for stealing rum from the commissary,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> found guilty, and
sentenced to receive, Curry seventy-five lashes, and Sellers fifty,
which was directly put in execution. Our camp remained; we continued
work on the road. After we returned from fatigue, Gen. Sullivan and
Col. Hoopes<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> arrived in our camp.</p>

to Easton. At 7 o'clock in the morning struck tents, the regiment
marched to Locust Hill and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>encamped there;<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> myself was ordered to
remain with the Commissary stores which could not move with the
baggage for want of teams.</p>

<p>Monday, 31st.&mdash;The Coll. sent the wagons back to fetch the stores. We
loaded them on the wagons and proceeded to Camp and arrived there at 2
o'clock in the afternoon. The troops worked on the road.</p>

<p>Tuesday, June 1st.&mdash;Worked on the road. The Camp remained on Locust

black bird's nest," the name of a town and village in south-west part
of Ulster County, N.Y., containing a post village of same name,
located on Rondout Creek on the line of the Delaware and Hudson Canal.
The surface of the town is mostly mountainous uplands, intersected by
deep valleys. The Shawangunk Mountains extend along the east border,
and spurs of the Catskills occupy the central and west parts, the
highest peaks being from 2,000 to 3,000 feet above tide. The eastern
and north-western parts are rocky and precipitous, and unfit for
cultivation. There was a stone fort in the village on the site of B.C.
Hornbeck's house. On Aug. 12, 1781, a large party of tories and
Indians under one Caldwell, appeared in the town with a design of
falling upon Napanock, but being informed that the place was defended
by cannon they came to Wawarsing before the inhabitants were up in the
morning. Two men and a young woman discovered the enemy before they
reached the fort, and the young woman succeeded in closing the door
just in time to prevent it from being burst open by the savages.
Finding further attack to be dangerous they dispersed and burned and
plundered the out settlements, and next day withdrew laden with
spoils. Several lives were lost on both sides and much property
destroyed.&mdash;The Indians&mdash;or Narratives of Massacres and Depredations
on the frontiers of Wawarsink and Vicinity, p. 21.</p></div>

name, about a mile from the present village of Ellenville, in the town
of Wawarsing, Ulster County. The attack was made at day-break by a
party of thirty or forty Indians under Brant, who came by the way of
the Indian trail to Grahamsville, and from thence through the woods to
the settlement. Widow Isaac Bevier and two sons were killed, also the
entire family of Michael Socks, consisting of the father, mother, two
sons who were young men, two children, and one or two others. They
attacked the house of Jesse Bevier, but the inmates being good
marksmen and having plenty of ammunition succeeded in defending
themselves until Col. Van Cortlandt came to their relief.</p>

<p class="noin">"As I was about marching from my encampment, having called in my
guard, I discovered smokes rising from the village about six miles
south, and a lad sent from its vicinity informed me that the Indians
were there burning and destroying. It was occasioned by two of my men
deserting in the mountains, when I received the order to return; for
they went to Brant and informed him that I was ordered away, and he
expected that I was gone. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* On my approach Brant ran off. He had
about one hundred and fifty Indians, and as I approached him, he being
on a hill, and seeing me leaning against a pine tree waiting for the
closing up of my men, ordered a rifle Indian to kill me, but he
overshot me, the ball passing three inches over my head."&mdash;Col. Van
Cortlandt's manuscript statement, 1825.</p>

<p class="noin">"General, while you were standing by a large tree during that battle,
how near to your head did a bullet come, which struck a little above
you?"</p>

<p class="noin">The General paused for a moment, and replied&mdash;"About two inches above
my hat."</p>

<p class="noin">Brant then related the circumstances. "I had remarked your activity in
the battle," said he, "and calling one of my best marksmen, pointed
you out and directed him to bring you down. He fired and I saw you
dodge your head at the instant I supposed the ball would strike. But
as you did not fall, I told my warrior that he had just missed you,
and lodged the ball in the tree." Conversation between Brant and

<div class="footnote"><p class="noin"><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> There were three paths leading eastward from Wyoming;
the southern, called the "warriors' path," by way of Fort Allen and
along the Lehigh to the Delaware Water Gap at Easton; the northern, by
way of the Lackawana at Capouse Meadows, through Cobb's Gap and the
Lackawaxen, to the Delaware and Hudson; the middle one, along which
this military road was constructed, led through the Wind Gap to
Easton. The massacre of Wyoming in 1778 had filled the forests along
this central trail with hundreds of helpless fugitives; some estimate
the number about two thousand, mostly women and children; many sunk
under the tomahawk, others died of excitement, fatigue, hunger and
exposure; many were lost and perished in the woods, while hundreds
were never seen or heard of after their precipitate flight. At this
time small parties of Indians still hovered around Wyoming. They
watched the passes, and occasionally exhibited extraordinary instances
of courage and audacity. Major Powell, with two hundred men of a
regiment that had suffered severely at the battle of Germantown,
having been ordered to Wyoming, arrived at Bear Creek about ten miles
from that point, on the 19th of April. Deeming themselves out of
danger from a surprise by the Indians, officers and men arrayed
themselves in their best apparel, burnished their arms and put
everything in shape for a respectable appearance on entering the
Valley. According to the fashion of the day the officers donned their
ruffles, powdered their hair, and with enlivening strains of music,
advanced toward their destination. The advance guard reported having
seen some deer, and Captain Davis, Lieutenant Jones and others,
started in pursuit; near the summit of the second mountain by the
Laurel Run, and about four miles from the fort, a fire was opened upon
them by the Indians in ambush. Davis, Jones, Corporal Butler and three
soldiers were killed and scalped. Chaplain Rogers says: "Scalped,
tomahawked and speared by the savages, fifteen or twenty in number;
two boards are fixed at the spot where Davis and Jones fell, with
their names on each. Jones's being besmeared with his own blood. In
passing this melancholy vale, an unusual gloom appeared on the
countenances of both officers and men without distinction, and from
the eyes of many, as by a sudden impulse, drops the sympathizing tear.
Colonel Proctor, out of respect to the deceased, ordered the music to
play the tune of Roslin Castle, the soft and moving notes of which,
together with what so forcibly struck the eye, tended greatly to fill
our breasts with pity, and to renew our grief for our worthy departed
friends and brethren." The bodies of the two officers were exhumed a
few weeks after this and re-interred at Wilkesbarre, with military and
masonic honors by the officers of Sullivan's army.</p></div>

Great Swamp, and Bear Swamp. The Great Swamp, which is eleven or
twelve miles through, contains what is called on our maps "shades of

amazing height, viz., hemlock, birch, pine, sugar maple, ash, locust,
etc. The roads in some places are tolerable, but in other places
exceeding bad, by reason of which, and a long though necessary march,
three of our wagons and the carriages of two field pieces were broken
down. This day we proceeded twenty miles and encamped late in the
evening at a spot which the commander named Camp Fatigue. The troops
were tired and hungry. The road through the Swamps is entirely new,
being fitted for the passage of our wagons by Colonels Cortlandt and
Spencer at the instance of the commander-in-chief; the way to Wyoming,
being before only a blind, narrow path. The new road does its
projectors great credit, and must in a future day be of essential
service to the inhabitants of Wyoming and Easton. In the Great Swamp
is Locust Hill, where we discovered evident marks of a destroyed
Indian village. Tobyhanna and Middle creeks empty into the Tunkhanunk;

</div>

<p class="noin">The Delaware name given to a valley on the Susquehanna river, of three
to four miles in width, by about sixteen in length, extending from the
mountain range above the Lackawana, where the river wends its way
through a gorge a thousand feet deep, south-westerly to where the
river again finds its way through a range equally lofty and
precipitous. This was the <span class="sc">Schahentoa</span> or
<span class="sc">Schahen-dowane</span> of the Iroquois, signifying <i>great plains</i>, as
does also the Delaware name of Wyoming. From its earliest known
history, this valley has been a favorite place of Indian residence,
and was the probable seat of an Iroquois tribe, called
<span class="sc">Schahentoar-ronons</span> by Brebeuf in 1635, whom he describes as
allies of the Hurons, and speaking their language. In 1614, three
Dutchmen in the employ of the Directors of New Netherland, accompanied
a party of Mahican Indians from near Fort Orange, in a war expedition
against the <span class="sc">Carantouannais</span>, a powerful Iroquois tribe, whose
main village containing more than eight hundred warriors, was located
on the so-called "Spanish Hill" near Waverly, N.Y. These Dutchmen were
captured by the Carantouannais, and were the first white men these
Indians had ever seen; believing them to be French, who were allies of
their friends the Hurons, they treated them kindly, and conducted them
down the Susquehanna to this point, and thence by way of the Lehigh
river, to the Delaware, where they were ransomed by Capt. Hendricksen,
"giving for them kittles, beads and merchandise." In the map made by
the Captain from information furnished by these Dutchmen, he indicated
four towns on the west side of the river, at this point, and
designated the tribe as <span class="sc">Minquas</span>, this being the general name
applied by the Dutch to all the Iroquois tribes south of the Five
Nations, and west of New Netherland, several of which are known to
have been in existence at that early date, but which appear to have
been entirely overlooked by the scholars of the country.</p></div>

Fifteen surrendered and composed the ring; upon the Indians beginning

wedge of land lying between the Chemung river and north branch of the
Susquehanna; from <i>Teyaogen</i>, an interval, or anything between two
other things [Bruyas, Agniers Racines]. <i>Teiohogen</i>, the forks of a
river (Gallatin's vocabulary 387). This has from time immemorial been
one of the most important strategical points of the country of the
Five Nations. Zeisberger passed through here in 1750 and says that "at
Tioga or <i>the gate</i>, Six Nations Indians were stationed for the
purpose of ascertaining the character of all persons who crossed over
into their country, and that whoever entered their territory by any
other way than through the gate, or by way of the Mohawk, was
suspected by them of evil purpose and treated as a spy or enemy." An

<p class="noin">The earliest known account of the place is found in Champlain, who
sent out one of his interpreters, named Stephen Brul&eacute;, in 1615, to
arrange with the Carantouannais for a force of five hundred warriors,
to co-operate with him in an attack on the Onondaga stronghold, then
located on the town of Fenner, Madison Co., N.Y. Brul&eacute; with a small
party of Hurons passed through the country of the Five Nations, to the
great town of Carantouan, containing more than eight hundred warriors,
then located on the so-called Spanish Hill near Waverly. Brul&eacute;
returned to Carantouan after the expedition, and the next year, 1616,
went down the Susquehanna to the sea "where he found many nations that
are powerful and warlike."</p>

<p class="noin">The three Dutchmen mentioned in note 44 passed down the Susquehanna
Branch and were probably the first white men who ever saw that river;
Brul&eacute;, the first that ever saw the Chemung.</p></div>

occupied in 1779, located on the left bank of the Chemung river about
five miles below Elmira, and a mile above the fortified position

brigade.</p>

<p class="noin">3d. A small village near the angle in the works of the enemy on

was occupied by the enemy as a block house during the engagement.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noin"><a name="Footnote_75_75" id="Footnote_75_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> <span class="sc">The Battle of Newtown</span> was fought on Sunday,
Aug. 29, 1779, near the Indian village of the same name, on the left
bank of the Chemung river six miles south east of Elmira. The enemy's
force of British regulars, two battalions of Royal Greens, and Tories,
were led by Colonel John Butler, with Captains Walter N. Butler and
Macdonald as subordinates; the Indians by the great Mohawk Captain
Thayendanegea, alias Joseph Brant, Butler being in chief command. The
design of the enemy appears to have been primarily, an ambuscade. They
had artfully concealed their works, and posted their forces in
positions to attack simultaneously, both flanks, front, and rear; the
position naturally strong, was admirably adapted to their purposes.
From Elmira, extending south easterly for several miles, is a
mountainous ridge, running parallel with the river, something over six
hundred feet in height near the Indian village, but gradually melting
away to the level of the plain where it terminates about a mile below;
on this south eastern slope was the battle of Newtown. To the north
and east of this ridge is a similar one, which also terminates near
the battle field, and between them is a considerable stream, which,
running nearly parallel with the river in its general course, enters
the Chemung a mile and a quarter below. The river here sweeps around
in a graceful curve, making a full semi-circle, enclosing several
hundred acres of rich bottom lands, on which were the Indian
cornfields; the Wellsburg north and south road dividing it into two
nearly equal parts. Rising abruptly from this plain is a sharp, narrow
ridge, known locally as the Hog Back, this extends from the river
across the plain nearly to the creek, a distance of about a third of a
mile. The crest of this ridge was occupied by the enemy in force,
protected by rude log breast works and rifle pits, which extended to
the eastern extremity, and from thence turning north, connected with
the steep banks of the creek above. The lines to be defended were
these two sides of a triangle, their right resting on the river, their
left on the mountain, the path of the army passing between the two
lines, along which was also the enemy's line of retreat. From the
angle in the works a thin line extended to the mountain, on which was
a body of the enemy and also another small body on the mountain to the
east. The results at Chemung a few days previous, led the enemy to
hope that a like blunder might be repeated, and that Wyoming and
Minnisinks were to be re-enacted. Presuming that the army, after
crossing the creek, would follow the Indian trail without discovering
their works, they flattered themselves that an unexpected fire on the
exposed flanks would create great confusion, which if augmented by
simultaneous attacks in front and rear by the forces in that quarter,
might result in a panic, and a possible stampede of the pack horses
and cattle, which would be quite as disastrous as the defeat of the
army. But three companies of Morgan's riflemen, the pride of
Washington, were in the advance; these veterans of a hundred battles
were in no way inferior to the enemy in Indian craft; the works and
position of the enemy were discovered when afar off, and this
ingenious device of drawing our forces into an ambuscade was
frustrated. The ambuscade failing, the alternative was presented of
forcing a direct attack in front, under great disadvantage, or of a
flanking movement, over very difficult ground, where nearly the entire
force of the enemy could be brought to bear on the attacking force at
any point on interior lines, possibly in time to repulse one division
of the army before the other could come to its relief. The attack in
front was invited by repeated sorties of a body of about four hundred
of the enemy, who would deliver their fire, and immediately retreat to
their works. After three hours of skirmishing, deliberation, and
reconnoitering, General Sullivan determined to divide his force, turn
the enemy's left, and attack simultaneously in front and flank.</p>

<p class="noin">The artillery was posted on a rising ground, three hundred yards from
the enemy, in position to enfilade the main line of their works, and
sweep the ground in the rear, Gen. Hand was to support the artillery,
the left flanking division to threaten the enemy's right, and Gen.
Maxwell's brigade to be held in reserve. Gen. Poor's brigade of four
regiments, the right flanking division, and the three companies of
riflemen, were to make a circuit of about two miles and turn the
enemy's left and attack in flank and rear, to be supported by General
Clinton's brigade of four regiments following as a second line. One
hour was allowed for this movement, at the expiration of which, the
artillery was to open, to be followed by a general assault of the two
divisions. Poor almost immediately after commencing his march, found
himself involved in a thicket of underbrush, almost impenetrable, but
after great difficulty reached the foot of the hill on which the enemy
was posted, just at the moment the artillery fire commenced. Forming
his line of battle with Lieut. Col. Reid's 2d N.H. on the extreme
left, next to him Lieut. Col. Dearborn's 2d N.H., then Alden's 6th
Mass., and Col. Cilley's 1st N.H. on the extreme right. To the right
of the brigade was the right flanking division of two hundred and
fifty men under Col. Dubois, the whole preceded by three companies of
riflemen under Maj. Parr. General Clinton's brigade formed line of
battle with Col. Gansevoort's 3d N.Y. on the left, next Dubois 5th
N.Y., then Livingston's 4th N.Y., with Van Courtlandt's 2d N.Y. on the
extreme right, following in the rear of the first line. Poor when
about half way up the hill encountered the enemy, but not in
sufficient force to materially check the advance of the flanking
division, or the regiments on his right; on reaching the summit of the
hill, these rapidly pushed forward to seize the defile near the river,
a short distance above Newtown, which was the only avenue of escape
for the enemy. Almost at the commencement of the cannonade, the main
force of the enemy adroitly abandoned their works without being
discovered, and precipitated themselves on Col. Reid's regiment in
greatly superior numbers. They swarmed about him in a semi-circle, and
for a few moments made the forest ring with their exultant shouts, but
for a few minutes only; for Col. Dearborn having reached the summit of
the hill, and missing Col. Reid on his left, on his own
responsibility, faced his regiment to the rear and moved to his
assistance. At the same moment the two regiments on the left of
Clinton's brigade by a left oblique movement, came up from the rear to
Reid's support, and the enemy soon found themselves dangerously
threatened. The conflict was short, sharp and decisive, and the war
whoop soon gave place to the retreat halloo. Poor with the remainder
of his brigade, followed by the two regiments on the right of Clinton,
had pushed rapidly for the defile. In the meantime Hand had advanced
in front, and the left flanking division under Col. Ogden had worked
its way along the river on the enemy's flank, when, the enemy
admirably commanded, and wisely discreet, sounded the signal for
retreat just in time to escape. A British account says: "In this
action Col. Butler and all his people was surrounded, and very near
being taken prisoners. On the same day a few miles from this he
attempted again to stop them, but in vain. The Colonel lost four
rangers killed, two taken prisoners and seven wounded." Twelve Indians
were found dead on the field, the number of wounded unknown. The enemy
were pursued for two or three miles above Newtown by the light troops,
where Salmon says they made another stand, which appears to be
confirmed by the account above quoted, but no details are given, and
the matter is not alluded to in Gen. Sullivan's official report. The
loss in killed according to the Indian official account, found four
days after, near Catharine's town is as follows: "Sept. 3d.&mdash;This day
found a tree marked 1779, Thandagana, the English of which is Brant,
12 men marked on it with arrows pierced through them, signifying the
number they had lost in the action of the 29th ultimo. A small tree
was twisted round like a rope and bent down which signified that if we
drove and distressed them, yet we would not conquer them."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noin"><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> The loss of our army is variously given in different
accounts of the action. Major Livermore (Journal Aug. 29) says that
"but four or five" were killed and three officers and about "thirty
others" were wounded. Lieut. Barton (Journal) that two or three of
ours were killed and "thirty-four or five wounded." Gen. Sullivan, in
a despatch written the next day after the fight, makes the entire loss
<i>three</i> killed and thirty nine wounded.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noin"><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> During the march this day two towns were burned, viz.:</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="sc">Middletown.</span>&mdash;A small Indian town mentioned in several
Journals as lying between Newtown and Kanawlohalla, on the north side
of the river, consisting of eight houses, destroyed Aug. 31 by the
army while on the march.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="sc">Kanawlohalla.</span>&mdash;Signifying <i>a head on a pole</i>, located on the
present site of Elmira, destroyed by Sullivan's army Aug. 31. In some
Journals this town is called Newtown, and the one near the battle
field Lower Newtown, but a majority designate it by its Indian name,
which, according to Mr. Maxwell should be spelled Canaweola, as
pronounced by Red Jacket, and who also gave the signification, and the
legend connected with it.</p>

<p class="noin">Col. Dayton with the 3d N.J. regiment and a detachment of riflemen
were detached here and sent up the river in pursuit of the enemy, whom
the advanced guard saw escaping in their canoes. He failed to overtake
them, but found an Indian village at or near present Big Flats, which
he destroyed. He encamped here for the night and rejoined the main
army the next morning, by a march north-east through the valley, where
the main body were encamped near present Horse Heads.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noin"><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> <span class="sc">Catharine's Town</span>&mdash;<i>She-o-qua-ga.</i>&mdash;An Indian
village located on the high ground a little south of the present
village of Havana. The town was on both sides of the inlet and about
three miles from the head of the lake. This was the residence of the
famous Catharine Montour, by many writers incorrectly confounded with
Madame Montour, and by others with Queen Esther, of Wyoming notoriety.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="sc">Madame Montour</span>, a noted personage in the Colonial history of
Pennsylvania, resided at one time at the present site of
Montoursville, in Pennsylvania, on the west branch of the Susquehanna,
afterwards on an island near Shamokin; and about 1749, when very aged
and blind, removed to the vicinity of Lake Erie, where she probably
died previous to 1752. She had several sons and one daughter, all
distinguished characters in Pennsylvania annals.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="sc">Queen Esther</span>, notorious as the "fiend of Wyoming," "who
followed in the train of the victorious army, ransacking the heaps of
slain, and with arms covered with gore barbarously murdering the
wounded who in vain supplicated for their lives." She was living at
Sheshequin six miles below Tioga point in 1772, and removed about that
date six miles north, and founded a new town, afterward known as Queen
Esther's town; this was afterward destroyed by Col. Hartley in 1778,
when she probably removed to Chemung. She had a sister Mary, and one
son, who lost his life a short time previous to the massacre of
Wyoming, which was probably the exciting cause of her fury at that
place. She afterward settled on the point south of Union Springs, in
Cayuga County, and died there of old age.</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="sc">Catharine Montour</span> was young enough to be the grand daughter
of Madame Montour. At the time of Sullivan's campaign and for some
years previous she had resided at her village near present Havana. She
had two sons, Roland and John, and a daughter Belle. Her sons were
conspicuous characters at Cherry Valley, Wyoming and in Sullivan's
campaign, where John was wounded in the battle of Newtown. Roland
married the daughter of Siangorochti, the chief sachem of the Senecas;
both sons were known as captains in the many Indian raids against the
border settlements. Catharine's reputed husband was Edward Pollard, a
sutler at Fort Niagara, who was also the father of the famous Seneca
warrior, Captain Pollard, by another Indian wife. There was at this
time another Capt. John Montour near Fort Pitt, who accompanied
Colonel Brodhead in his expedition up the Allegany, who was loyal to
the American cause throughout the war. In this expedition of Col.
Brodhead, the husband of Belle Montour was killed.</p></div>

located on the east side of Seneca Lake on the present site of North
Hector, was so called in 1778 by Luke Swetland, who passed through it
while on his way to Kendaia. It was burned by the army Sept. 4, 1779.
It is called Apple Town in William Barton's Journal.</p></div>

located on lot 79 Romulus, on the east side of Seneca lake, on land
now owned by Edward Van Vliet. It was about half a mile from the lake,
on both sides of a small stream. Luke Swetland resided here for a year
as a prisoner, until rescued by the army. Several journals give
interesting accounts of this town, and especially of the Indian tombs,
which appear to have been arranged with more than ordinary care. It
was the custom on the death of distinguished personages to paint on
their monumental posts a record of important events relating to the
history of the deceased person. The fact that these tombs were
different in construction and style of ornamentation from others,
suggests the idea that they were a remnant of some subjugated tribe,
differing in mode of burial from the Iroquois. A noted Seneca warrior
named Kendaia was conspicuous at the siege of Ft. Niagara in 1759.</p></div>

"drafted on the right flank, which was commanded by Col. Dubois." He
was probably one of the one hundred men drafted from the line, as part
of the right flanking division, and consequently would be on the
extreme right of the army while <i>en route</i>. The centre line of the
army was the regular Indian trail, which was opened to a sufficient
width for the passage of the artillery. Along Seneca Lake, the present
lake road follows substantially on the line of the trail.</p>

<p class="noin">At this point, Beatty says "we encamped close along the edge of the
lake, and opposite to us on the west side of the lake, we could
perceive a small Indian town." See note 84, Gothseungquean.</p></div>

Journals, an Indian town of 18 houses, located about a mile north west
of Conesus Centre, on the north and south road that passes through the
McMillen farm. Between the town and the lake on Henderson's flats were
the cornfields. The village appears to have occupied the grounds in
the vicinity of the McMillen residence, and extended north across the
creek, and southward to the plateau now covered by an orchard which
was probably an ancient palisaded site of the town. The main body of
the army encamped on the night of the 12th nearly two miles north on
the flats, south-west of Foot's corners. A local tradition exists that
Hand with the light troops followed the road through Union Corners and
encamped on the L.B. Richardson farm, south west of Conesus Centre at
the False Faces, but nothing of the kind is found in any of the
journals, and is probably incorrect. George Grant says a fine stream
of water ran through the town, and that "Captain Sunfish, a negro,
resided here, a very bold, enterprising fellow, who commanded the
town." Several Journals mention the fact that Big Tree, a noted Indian
warrior, also made this his home. President Dwight describes him as a
man of lofty character and dignified deportment, and that he had
strenuously urged his countrymen to observe strict neutrality, but
without success. The chieftain stood on an elevated spot and saw his
own possessions destroyed. "You see how the Americans treat their
friends," said some of those around him, favorable to Great Britain.
"What I see," calmly replied the chief, "is only the common fortune of
war. It cannot be supposed that the Americans can distinguish my
property from yours, who are their enemies." The army was engaged
until near noon in destroying the crops and re-building the bridge
which had been destroyed by the enemy.</p></div>

important matters connected with Sullivan's campaign, has, for a
hundred years, remained a stumbling block and mystery to historians.
This has arisen in part from erroneous views as to the location of
Gathtsegwarohare and the trails, but mainly from the mistaken idea
that Boyd's party was the force against which the efforts of the enemy
were originally directed, rather than that it was a formidable attempt
to ambuscade the main army.</p>

<p class="noin">From Kanaghsaws the trail led south westerly across the low grounds
following the line of the present road near the inlet, and crossing it
at, or very near the site of the present bridge, about three-fourths
of a mile from the head of the lake. North of the bridge, the banks of
the inlet are low and marshy, in many places impassable for infantry,
and at all points impassable for artillery and pack horses; while
south of the bridge, is a wet swamp almost impenetrable from the thick
growth of underbrush, west of the lake and Inlet is a steep hillside,
the face of which, cut up by numerous ravines, is so steep that with
considerable difficulty an army could march directly up it. The trail
after leaving the bridge probably continued south westerly up the hill
obliquely, nearly on the line of the present highway to the summit of
the bluff, and thence turning northwest followed along the heads of
the ravines for a mile and thence directly west to Gathtsegwarohare.
Directly west of the bridge, between two very deep ravines, is a space
nearly half a mile in width, which continues up the hill on very
favorable ground for the advance of the army. It appears to be the
only point where it could advance in the order of march laid down,
which would require a space of nearly a half a mile in width for the
several columns.</p>

<p class="noin">After the battle of Newtown, Butler and Brant with their demoralized
forces, sullenly retired, powerless to prevent the advance of the
devastating army. Butler had reached the last Indian village of
Canawaugas, located on the west side of the Genesee, twelve miles
north of the Great Genesee Castle. Here he received re-inforcements of
regulars from Niagara, and determined to make one more effort against
the invaders. Gathering all his available forces of regulars, tories,
and Indians, he left Canawaugas on the morning of the 12th of
September, and probably reached the position on the hill west of
Kanaghsaws, on the evening of the same day. Here they posted
themselves north of the trail, at the heads of the ravines about
three-fourths of a mile west of the bridge, and a mile and a half from
Kanaghsaws. This was a most admirable position for an ambuscade, and
in many essential particulars of topography and fact, bears a striking
resemblance to the fatal ground where Braddock so ingloriously
sacrificed his army; and had Sullivan advanced in the same blundering
manner, he too, might have met with an equally disastrous defeat. The
plan appears to have been, to attack a portion of the army after it
had crossed the bridge, or to ambuscade the head of the column while
ascending the hill; but whatever may have been the original design, it
was completely frustrated by the fortunate movements of the
unfortunate Boyd. It will be remembered that the army went into camp
on the flats near Foot's Corners two miles north of the village of
Kanaghsaws. Boyd and his party left camp at 11 o'clock at night,
passed through the abandoned Kanaghsaws, and from thence pursued the
direct trail which led south westerly up the hill to Gathtsegwarohare.
In the darkness of the night, he passed Butler's right flank, neither
party being conscious of the presence of the other, and reached
Gathtsegwarohare, which the inhabitants had abandoned early in the
morning, without encountering any difficulty. On the morning of the
13th Sullivan advanced to Kanaghsaws, and finding that the enemy had
destroyed the bridge over the inlet, he detailed a portion of the army
to aid the pioneers in its re-construction, and to repair the roadway
over the low grounds leading to it. All of this was directly under the
eye of Butler, who, according to a British account, "lay undiscovered
though only a musket shot from the rebels, and even within sight." On
reaching the town Boyd halted his forces at the suburbs, himself and
one of his men reconnoitered the place, then rejoined the party and
concealed themselves in the woods near the town. He sent back two of
his men to report to General Sullivan, and awaited the light of the
day whose morning was just breaking. These two men got through safely
and reported. About daybreak four Indians were seen to enter the town
by Boyd, one of whom was killed, another wounded, the rest escaped.
Boyd then immediately set out to return, expecting to meet the army on
the march, and when about half way, despatched two more men to inform
the general of his intention to remain "on the path" and await the
coming of the army. These men soon encountered five Indians, and
returned; the entire party then resumed the march, following and
firing on the retreating Indians, who lured them directly into the
lines of the enemy. Colonel Butler hearing the firing on his right and
rear imagined he was discovered, and that instead of ambuscading the
rebels, he was himself to be surprised by this unexpected attack in
the rear. No evidence whatever has appeared to confirm the conjecture,
that Boyd's presence was either known or suspected in that quarter, by
Butler, or any portion of his force, until discovered by the five
retreating Indians, and to them, only by accident; but when discovered
with true aboriginal cunning they allured their unsuspecting victims
to the fatal embrace of the enemy, who came there to surprise an army,
but were prevented by the blundering of a scout.</p>

<p class="noin">A few of Boyd's party who were acting as flankers escaped, five or six
fell near the trail and were found when the army advanced, the
remainder retreated a short distance north to a clump of trees, where
their bodies were found all near together, and where all the bodies
were buried on the return march of the army on the 16th. During the
construction of the bridge a guard had been established west of the
inlet, and Captain Lodge with his party engaged in making their
surveys, had advanced some distance up the hill; the bridge was about
completed when the fugitive flankers came rushing down the hill
pursued by small parties of the enemy. Hand's brigade immediately
advanced up the hill to the position occupied by the enemy in the
morning, where he found the packs of the enemy in the position they
had left a few minutes previous. He remained here in line of battle
until the army had crossed, and formed for the advance up the hill.</p></div>

<i>Gaghegwalahale</i> by Dearborn; <i>Cassawauloughly</i> by Hardenburgh, was
seven miles directly west of Kanaghsaws, on the east side of
Canaseraga creek about two miles above its confluence with the Genesee
river. Here is a beautiful plateau of about six acres, admirably
adapted for an Indian town, at present occupied by the house and
surrounding grounds of the widely known "Hermitage," the ancestral
home of the Carolls. The town contained twenty-five houses, mostly
new, and appears to have been located on both sides of the stream
north of the Caroll mansion. The tribe residing here called
Squa-tche-gas by Sullivan; by the Onondagas Tchoueragak, signifying
wild cats; by Cusic Squakihows, and by others Kah-kwas, were the same
that afterward settled at Squakie-Hill, to whom was reserved the two
square miles in the Big Tree Treaty of 1797. They were a remnant of
one of the tribes of the historic Eries, who occupied the territory to
the south and east of Lake Erie whose blood, language, and league did
not differ materially from the Iroquois Five Nations. After a terrible
conflict, and many bloody battles the Eries were finally overthrown
about the year 1655, and a remnant incorporated with the league. They
were permitted to live by themselves, to have a separate council fire
and keep up a show of tribal rites, but were really vassals to do the
bidding of their masters. Boyd and his party reached this town about
at the break of day on the morning of the 13th, and found it
abandoned. He sent two of his men to report to Gen. Sullivan and
concealed his force in the adjacent woods. Soon after four Indians on
horseback entered the town, one of whom, Sah-nah-dah-yah, was killed
and scalped by Murphy, when Boyd set out for camp. As Sullivan
approached the town about dark on the 13th, he found the enemy, both
Indians and rangers drawn up in battle array apparently intending to
dispute the further advance of the army; but as the advancing columns
assumed their positions in line of battle, and the flanking divisions
moved to the right and left, threatening their lines of retreat, a few
shots from the howitzers caused them to abandon their position, and
retreat across the Canaseraga. The army were engaged until noon of the
14th in destroying the cornfields which were very extensive in the
vicinity of the town.</p></div>

at the time of Sullivan's campaign, is intimately connected with its
history. It was located on the site of ancient Williamsburg, near the
confluence of the Canaseraga and the Genesee, on the east side of the
latter river. It appears on the Guy Johnson map of 1771 as Chenussio,
on the Pouchot map of 1758 as Connecchio, in both cases at the point
described and where Mary Jennison's narrative says it was in her day.
In 1750 it was visited by Cammerhoff and Zeisberger, two Moravian
missionaries, who called it Connesschio and describe it as then
containing forty houses. All of these names are dialectical and
orthographical variations of the modern word Genesee, signifying <i>the
beautiful valley</i>. Gaustarax, a celebrated Seneca Chief, was for many
years a leading spirit of this town, and during the French and Indian
war, being thoroughly in the interests of the French, it required all
the diplomatic ability of Sir William Johnson, and the influence of
the other nations of the league, to neutralize his efforts. It was in
existence as early as 1750, and as late as 1770, but in 1768 it had
ceased to be the western door, which honor was then held by the great
town of Chenandoanes, on the west side of the river. At the time of
Sullivan's campaign it had ceased to exist or had dwindled into an
insignificance unworthy of mention.</p>

<p class="noin">This was the town that Boyd was sent to reconnoitre, and which Major
Norris says the General expected to find on the east side of the river
and two miles north of Gathtsegwarohare. This is the town also, that
writers confound with the great town west of the river, and which so
perplexed General Sullivan in his examination of the maps.</p></div>

the Senecas, the western door of the Long House, located between
Cuylerville and the west bank of the Genesee river, in the town of
Leicester, Livingston County. It appears on Evans' map as Chenandoanes
in 1776, is mentioned as early as 1754 as Chenandanah, and is often
called Little Beard's town. Sullivan's official report says: "The
Castle consisted of 128 houses mostly large and elegant. The place was
beautifully situated, almost encircled with a cleared flat, which
extended for a number of miles, where the most extensive fields of
corn were waving, and every kind of vegetable that can be conceived."</p></div>

and Ohadi and Big Tree on the east side of Genesee river were
destroyed in this campaign. No reliable authority has been furnished
in support of the theory. Sullivan says distinctly that he went no
farther than the great town, beyond which, as he was informed, there
was no settlement, and no villages are mentioned in any account as
existing on the east side of the river, nor is mention made of any
portion of the army being on that side,&mdash;on the contrary, several
mention the fact, that <i>all the army</i> were engaged in the destruction
of the town, and cornfields, which, when completed at 2 o'clock on the
afternoon of the 15th, <i>the whole army</i> came to an about face, and
returned on the same route and in same order in which they advanced.
Butler left Canawaugas on the morning of the 15th for Niagara.</p></div>

at the time she and her little boy were taken prisoners, her husband
was killed by the savages; that she had lived with the Indians some
two years, and when the army entered the town, the day before, the
Indians were in such haste to get out it that she could not follow
them and finally lost herself in the woods, and thinking it might be
Butler's camp she had ventured to show herself. She was taken to the
General's Quarters and well provided for. During the march the woman
and her boy were furnished with a horse. On the third day of the march
the child was taken sick and shortly after died. The boy was wrapped
in an old blanket and hastily buried. The scene is described as
exceedingly touching. She afterward married Roswell Franklin, the

<h3>GENERAL CLINTON'S MARCH DOWN THE SUSQUEHANNA.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>General James Clinton was born in Orange County, New York, August 9th,
1736. He was third son of Colonel Charles Clinton, brother of Governor
George Clinton, and father of Governor DeWitt Clinton, of New York.
During the French and English war, in 1756, he distinguished himself
at the capture of Fort Frontenac, where he was a Captain under
Bradstreet. Seven years later he commanded the regiments raised to
protect the frontiers of Orange and Ulster counties against Indian
incursions. In 1775, with the rank of Colonel, he accompanied the
chivalric Montgomery to Quebec. He was appointed a brigadier, August
9th, 1776, and commanded Fort Clinton when it was attacked in October,
1777, by Sir Henry Clinton; his brother, George Clinton, at same time
being in command of Fort Montgomery. After a gallant defense against
superior numbers, the forts were carried by storm, Gen. Clinton being
the last man to leave the works. He was stationed at West Point during
the greater part of 1778. In 1779 he commanded the brigade of New York
troops under General Sullivan. With a force of 1600 men he ascended
the Mohawk to Canajoharie, and thence across to Otsego lake. Here he
collected a large number of batteaux, and erecting a dam at the foot
of the lake, raised the water several feet. By tearing away the dam,
an artificial flood was made, on which the batteaux floated to the
place of meeting at Tioga, the army marching alongside by land. The
Journals of Lieut. Van Hovenbergh and Major Beatty give an account of
this march.</p>

<h3 class="sc">Major Erkuries Beatty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></h3>

<p>Major Erkuries Beatty, was born October 9, 1759, son of Rev. Charles
Beatty, who came to America from Ireland in 1729. He was an apprentice
in Elizabethtown, N.J., at the beginning of the revolution, and served
with the Jersey troops; was at Long Island Aug. 9, 1776, under General
Sterling, and served as a sergeant at White Plains, Oct 28. He was
commissioned an Ensign in the 4th Penn. regiment, with rank from Jan.
3, 1777; was promoted to Lieutenant May 2, and was engaged in the
battle of Brandywine, Sept. 11th of same year. He was badly wounded at
Germantown, but rejoined his regiment at Valley Forge in January,
1778. He was at Monmouth June 28 of that year, and shortly after
accompanied his regiment to Schoharie, N.Y. He was with Col. Van
Schaick in his expedition against the Onondagas in June, 1779, and
with his regiment accompanied Gen. Clinton down the Susquehanna to
participate in Sullivan's campaign, during which he wrote a Journal
covering the period from June 11 to Oct. 22 of that year, of which the
following is a part, the original of which is now in the archives of
the New York Historical Society, to whose courtesy we are indebted for
permission to make a copy. He was at the surrender of Cornwallis Oct.
19, was mustered out of service Nov. 3, 1783, and died at Princeton,
N.J., Feb. 23, 1823.</p>

<h3 class="sc">Part of Beatty's Journal, 1779.</h3>

<p>Monday, Aug. 9.&mdash;Agreeable to yesterday's order the Gen'l beat at 6
o'clock, the troops marched about 8, excepting 3 Men which was to
remain in each boat to take them down the River. The Infantry march in
front which I now belong to, and the Remainder of Battalions next,
marched <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>on 16 miles within 5 miles of Yorkham's<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> where we
encamped on a small improvement called Burrows'<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> farm where there
was a great many Rattlesnakes and very large, there was one killed
with 15 rattles on.</p>

<p>Tuesday 10.&mdash;Rained, a little last night and this day till 10
o'clock&mdash;marched off the ground at 3 o'clock and went 5 miles to
Yorkham's where we encamped, the men in the Boats encamped on the farm
which lies on the East side of the River and the Remainder on the
other side opposite, went on guard to-night.</p>

<p>Wednesday 11.&mdash;Marched off this morning at Sunrise and proceeded on 14
miles down the River where we encamped on a small farm, passed several
farms to-day with very poor houses on them and some none, the Riflemen
in front saw fresh Indian tracks to-day on the Path and found a *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
at one of their *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* To-day we crossed a large creek called Otego,
and passed several Indian encampments, where they had encamped when
they were going to destroy Cherry Valley or returning, likewise we
passed one of their encampments yesterday, we encamped to-night at
Ogden's farm and very bad encamping ground.</p>

<p>Thursday 12.&mdash;Marched off this morning 7 o'clock, had the advanced
Guard to-day, proceeded down the West side of the River as usual, 12
Miles came to a small Scotch settlement called Albout<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> on the
other side of the River 5 miles from Unadilla which we burnt, but the
people had gone to the Enemy this last Spring, went on to Unadilla,
crossed the River to the East side and encamped, the River was about
middle deep when we waded it. This settlement was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>destroyed by our
detachment last fall excepting one house which belonged to one
Glasford who went to the enemy this Spring, his house was immediately
burnt when we came on the ground to-day. We passed several old Indians
encamp'ts where they encamped when they destroyed Cherry Valley, the
road middling hilly.</p>

<p>Friday 13th.&mdash;This morning very foggy and a great deal of dew. Marched
off at 6 o'clock, went 2 miles, waded the River about 3 foot deep,
proceeded on to Conihunto<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> a small Indian village that was, but
was Destroyed by our Detachment last fall, its 14 miles from
Unadilla.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> A little below this town there is 3 or 4 Islands in the
River where the Indians raised their corn. On one of those Islands our
troops encamped with the boats and cattle, the light Infantry went 2
miles from Conihunto where they encamped a little after 3 o'clock in
the woods. Middle good Road to-day.</p>

<p>Saturday 14th.&mdash;Marched this morning at 8 o'clock, very hilly road for
the Right flank, arrived at the fording 2 miles from Onoquaga<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
about 2 o'clock which is 8 from where we started, the ford being too
deep to wade, crossed in our Boats to the East Side, went over a high
hill and got to Onoquaga at 3 o'clock where we encamped on very pretty
ground. This town was one of the neatest of the Indian towns on the
Susquehanna, it was built on each side of the River with good <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>log
houses with stone chimneys and glass windows, it likewise had a church
and burying ground and a great number of apple-trees, and we likewise
saw the Ruins of an Old Fort which formerly was here many years ago.
The Indians abandoned this town last fall when they heard of our
detachment coming to destroy it, they had but just left it when we
came in it, but we did not catch any of them, but burnt their town to
ashes, and the detachment returned. This evening we fired an evening
gun.</p>

<p>Sunday 15th.&mdash;Very heavy dew this morning, went on Guard, the Army
Remain at Onoquago to-day quiet, no news stirring as I hear of
particular.</p>

<p>Monday 16th.&mdash;This morning a very heavy dew and fog, which is very
customary in this country, was relieved of my Guard and the day proved
exceedingly warm, a heavy shower of rain this afternoon, at 12 o'clock
Major Church with the 4th P. Regt. went out 5 or 6 Miles to meet 4 or
500 Militia<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> who we expected to join us here, but he returned in
the evening and saw nothing of them.</p>

<p>Tuesday 17th.&mdash;Marched off from Onoquaga this morning 8 o'clock,
proceeded down the river 3 miles to one of the Tuscarora towns, which
was burnt by one of our Detachments last fall, here waded the river
about 4 feet deep to the west side, went on one Mile when we came to
another of the Tuscarora towns called Shawhiangto<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> consisting of
10 or 12 houses which we burnt, then marched on over a very barren
mountainous country 10 or 12 Miles, came to a Tuscarora settlement
called Ingaren<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> consisting of 5 or 6 houses, but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>a good deal
scattered, encamped at the lower end of the settlement after burning
the houses, here they had planted a good deal of corn, potatoes, &amp;c.,
which we destroyed, a few yards in front of our comp'ys encamping
ground there was a tanfat farm with several Hides at a tannery which
the soldiers got, and close by it they discovered in a little hole, a
man which was laid there and a little dirt thrown over him just to
cover him. We had his head uncovered, but he was too putrified, we
could not discover whether he was a white man or Indian but supposed
to be a white man, as there was a Scotch Bonnet found near him.
Marched to-day 15 miles.</p>

<p>Wednesday 18th.&mdash;Marched off from Ingaren 7 o'clock through a very
fine rich country very well timbered but poorly watered, scarce any;
arrived at Chinango River at 4 o'clock where we forded it about 4 feet
deep, and almost as wide as the Susquehanna but not so deep, as soon
as we got over we halted and Major Parr with 100 men went up the River
to destroy the Chinango town<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> which lay 4 miles up the River, but
when we came there, we found the town was burnt, which consisted of
about 20 houses. It seems when the Indians evacuated it last winter
they destroyed it, therefore we Returned and found the army encamped 2
Mile below the Chinango River. Marched to-day 22 miles, and burnt
several Indian houses on the road. This evening came up the River 2
Runners who informed us that Gen'l Poor with 1000 Men was within 9
miles of us coming to meet us and that Genl. Sullivan lay at the mouth
of the Tyoga and that he had sent part of his army up to Shamong which
they had destroyed, and had returned to Gen'l Sullivan with the loss
of 9 men killed and some more wounded, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>which was in small
skirmishing. The Indians had taken off all their [property] from
Shamong, except a few cattle which our people got.</p>

<p>Thursday 19th.&mdash;Marched this morning 7 o'clock, went 2 Miles where we
burnt 7 or 8 houses on the East side of the River, 4 miles further at
the Chuggnuts<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> we fell in with Gen'l Poor's army who was ready to
march, they had burnt this settlement which lies on the East side of
the River about 20 houses, made no halt here but went on 4 mile, Gen'l
Clinton's army in front and Gen'l Poor's in the rear. Came to a
middling large Creek where we made a halt for one hour, then marched
on 12 Miles without halting and arrived at Owego<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> about sundown
after a very fatiguing march of 22 Miles. This afternoon fell a small
shower of Rain.</p>

<p>Friday 20th.&mdash;Rained a little last night, and successively all this
day therefore did not move, went a party down to Owego town which lies
one mile lower down and burnt it, consisted of about 20 houses.</p>

<p>Saturday 21.&mdash;Clear weather this morning but a very heavy fog, marched
a little after 7 o'clock, forded Owego creek which is about *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* one
third of the Susquehanna, at this place it was about three feet deep
and about 50 yards wide&mdash;Went thro. the *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* of Owego town, crossed a
pretty large brook, went 12 miles, halted at a small brook one hour
for refreshment. Proceed on 3 Miles further when we <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>encamped at 4
o'clock opposite Fitzgerald's farm<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> in the woods, it is a very
fine farm but no house on it, nor any body living on it. On this
ground where we encamped Mr. Sawyers a man who was made prisoner by
Indians, along with his Neighbor Mr. Cowley who both lived on the head
of the Delaware, after the Indians having them so far on their
Journey, they rose in the Night killed the Indians which was 3 or 4
and made their escape, we saw the *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* of the Indians *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* when we
came on the ground. To-day we met with a bad accident, two of our
Boats of Ammunition overset in the River and Damaged a good many boxes
of cartridges and a few casks of powder, to-night went on Guard.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Sunday 22d.&mdash;Marched off this morning 7 o'clock, proceeded on, we
crossed two middling large brooks. Arrived at Tyoga 11 o'clock, where
we found Genl. Hand's Brigade encamped one Mile above the mouth of the
Tyoga where they was building 4 Block houses, the other troops was
encamped over the point which was Gen'ls Poor's and Maxwell's
Brigades, we encamped on the Right of the whole. On our coming into
camp we was saluted by 13 Pieces of cannon which was Returned by our
two little pieces on the River. We found Gen'l Hand's Brigade under
arms with a Band of Music which played Beautiful as we passed by them,
We encamped on a very *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* pretty piece of ground and spent the
Remainder of the day in seeing our friends in the different Regiments,
likewise when we arrived here our Infantry was disbanded and ordered
to join their respective Regts. Very heavy shower of rain this
afternoon. Marched 7 miles to-day.</p>

<p class="noin">Early in the spring of 1779, two men named Sawyer and Cowley were
captured near Harpersfield, by four Schoharie Indians, named Han
Yerry, Seth's Henry, Adam and Nicholas. One of the captives was an
Irishman, the other a Scotchman. They were refugees from Harpersfield,
who had sought safety in Schoharie at the beginning of the
difficulties. The prisoners could not speak Dutch, which the Indians
understood, nor could the Indians understand English. When captured,
they claimed by signs to be friends of the King, and were not only
willing, but anxious to accompany their captors. The prisoners set off
with such apparent willingness on the journey, that the Indians did
not think it necessary to bind them, but permitted them to procure
wood and water. They had been captives eleven days without finding a
favorable opportunity for escape, but on arriving at a deserted hut at
this point, the captives were sent to cut wood a few rods distant,
using for this purpose an ax belonging to one of the prisoners. On
such occasions, usually one cut and the other carried to the camp
fire; but this time, while Cowley was chopping, and Sawyer waiting for
an armful, the latter took from his pocket a newspaper, and pretended
to read its contents to his fellow, but really proposed a plan for
regaining their liberty. After procuring a sufficient quantity of
wood, and partaking of a scanty supper, they laid down for the night
as usual, a prisoner between two Indians. When the Indians were sound
asleep, the prisoners arose, secured the guns, shaking the priming
from them, Sawyer securing the tomahawk of Han Yerry, and Cowley the
ax. At a given signal, the blows descended, and the weapons sank deep
into the brain of their victims, but unfortunately, Sawyer in
attempting to free his weapon from the skull, drew the handle from its
socket. These two Indians were killed, but the noise awoke the others,
who instantly sprung to their feet; as Seth's Henry arose, he received
a blow partially warded off by his right arm, but his shoulder was
laid open and he fell back stunned; the fourth, as he was about to
escape, received a heavy blow in the back from the ax; he fled to a
swamp near by and died. On returning to the hut and consulting as to
what course they should pursue, Seth's Henry, who had recovered, but
feigned death, again sprang to his feet, caught his rifle and snapped
it at one of the prisoners, ran out of the hut and disappeared. The
two friends primed the remaining guns and kept vigilant watch until
daylight to guard against surprise. They set out in the morning to
return, but did not dare to pursue the route they came, very properly
supposing there were more of the enemy in the vicinity, to whom the
surviving Indian would communicate the fate of his comrades. They
re-crossed the river in a bark canoe which they had used the preceding
afternoon, and then directed their course for the frontier
settlements. On the first night, Cowley, carried away by the
excitement was deranged for hours, and his companion was fearful that
his raving would betray them, but reason returned with daylight. As
they had feared, a party of Indians was soon in hot pursuit&mdash;from a
hill they saw ten or a dozen in the valley below; but they concealed
themselves beneath a sheltering rock, and remained there one night and
two days. When there an Indian dog came up to them, but after smelling
for some time, went away without barking. On the third night they saw
the enemy's fires literally all around them. They suffered much from
exposure to the weather, and still more from hunger, but finally
arrived at a frontier settlement in Pennsylvania, and afterward
returned to Schoharie, where they were welcomed as though risen from
the dead. Sawyer is said to have died many years after in
Williamstown, Mass., and Cowley in Albany.&mdash;<i>Symm's Schoharie</i>, 291,

<h3 class="sc">March of Colonel Butler Along the East Side of Cayuga Lake.</h3>

<p>On the return march, when the army reached Kanadaseaga on September
20, Lieutenant Colonel Butler commanding the Fourth Pennsylvania
regiment was detached with six hundred men, with orders to proceed
around the north end of Cayuga lake, and devastate the country of the
Cayugas on the east side of the lake. At the same time a force under
Lieutenant Colonel Henry Dearborn was ordered to move along the west
side, the two detachments to unite at the head of the lake and from
thence to join the main army at Catharinestown.</p>

<p><span class="sc">William Butler</span> was the second of five brothers, all of whom
served with distinction in the Revolution and the succeeding wars.
Their names were Richard, William, Thomas, Percival and Edward.
Thomas, the third brother, is said to have been born in Pennsylvania
in 1754, and Richard the elder in Ireland, so that William was either
born in America, or came here from Ireland when very young. He was
commissioned Lieutenant Colonel October 25, 1776, on the organization
of the Fourth Pennsylvania Regiment. Immediately after the battle of
Monmouth, in which he bore an important part, his regiment and six
companies of Morgan's riflemen were sent to Schoharie County, New
York, where he was actively engaged in protecting the frontier
settlements from the marauding parties of tories and Indians. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>After
the Wyoming massacre in 1778, as a part of the aggressive policy
determined on by Washington, he marched to the Delaware, and descended
that stream for two days, and from thence moved across the country to
the Susquehanna at Unadilla in pursuit of the enemy, who fled at his
approach. From here he moved down to Onoquaga, which was a well built
town, with many good farm houses in the vicinity belonging to the
tories, located on both sides of the river. He destroyed Onoquaga, and
a Tuscarora town lower down, Conihunto eight miles above, and
Unadilla, with the grist and saw mill there, the only ones in the
valley, and forced the enemy to remove westward to the Chemung where
they were found by Sullivan the next year. He was in garrison in the
Middle fort of Schoharie during the winter, and in August, 1779,
accompanied Clinton down the Susquehanna to Tioga point where he was
transferred to General Hand's Brigade August 23d of that year. This
was the Colonel Butler to whom General Sullivan entrusted the
responsible duties of conducting this important expedition, second
only in importance to that of the main army. Two journals give an
account of Colonel Butler's march, viz., Thomas Grant, who appears to
have been one of the surveying party under Captain Lodge, and George
Grant, Sergeant Major of the Third New Jersey regiment, the latter
evidently copied from some other journal.</p>

<p>Sept. 20.&mdash;This day a detachment of six hundred men with a sufficiency
of officers under the command of Col. Wm. Butler were sent into the
Cayuga country, with which detachment I was ordered. They marched from
Cannadesago at 3 o'clock <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> Marched this day 8 miles to an
Indian <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>town by the name of Scawyace<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> where about 8 acres of corn
was destroyed.</p>

<p>Sept 21.&mdash;The detachment marched this morning at 7 o'clock
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> 16-&frac12; miles to a small Indian settlement<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> 1-&frac12;
miles short of Cayuga Castle, where we encamped for the night. At
8-&frac12; miles crossed the outlet of Cayuga, which in breadth was about
70 perches, and more than middle deep to the men. Near the outlet we
destroyed two Indian houses. The name of the place Choharo<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and
destroyed on the lake in different places *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* houses and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* acres
of corn, but saw no enemy. The general course since we crossed the
outlet, nearly south, the road not more than half a mile from the lake
at furthest, the land middling.</p>

<p>Sept. 22, 1779.&mdash;Marched this day at 6 o'clock <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> 2 miles
to the Cayuga Castle,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> an Indian town of that name containing in
number about 15 very large square log houses. I think the building
superior to any yet have seen. [Here] cattle were killed and three
days beef issued to the troops. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>The fatigue parties were sent to
destroy the corn to the amount of about 110 acres, though not all
destroyed this day. Two other towns were discovered, one 23-&frac12; miles
from the Seneca Lake, which we called Upper Cayuga,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> containing 14
large houses, the other about two miles east of the Castle which we
called Cayuga,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> containing 13 houses. The troops were all employed
this day in destroying corn till after dark. We found at this town
apples, peaches, potatoes, turnips, onions, pumpkins, squashes, and
vegetables of various kinds and great plenty.</p>

<p>Sept. 23, 1779.&mdash;This day the troops were employed till 3 o'clock
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> in finishing the destruction of the corn and burning the
aforementioned towns within. Marched 5 miles to an Indian town by the
name of Chandot<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> or Peach Town, remarkable for a large Peach
orchard containing *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* hundred fine thriving peach trees, likewise *
*&nbsp;* acres of corn. This town contained about 12 or 14 houses chiefly
old buildings. Part of the corn was destroyed this evening.</p>

<p>Sept. 24, 1779.&mdash;This morning the troops were employed in finishing
the destruction of the corn and peach trees. At 10 o'clock
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> fire was set to this town and the detachment went off
the ground. Marched this day 16-&frac12; miles and encamped on a pleasant
hill<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> near a fine creek about one hour after dark. The land we
passed this day well timbered, and the soil very good, but very scarce
of water. 9 miles from Chondote we crossed a stream of water which
fell over <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>rocks 80 feet perpendicular. 3 miles from [this] we crossed
a second stream<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> which fell about 50 feet perpendicular, which
empty themselves into Cayuga lake. Saw no enemy this day. The general
course S. 30&deg; E.</p>

<p>Sept. 25, 1779.&mdash;Marched this morning about 6 o'clock and encamped at
an Indian town 3-&frac12; miles above Cayuga Lake. The town appeared to be
just consumed, supposed to be burnt by a detachment from Gen'l
Sullivan's army.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The town was situated on a rising ground in a
large, beautiful valley. The soil equal to or rather superior to any
in the country, through which runs several fine streams of water, the
first a creek about 4 poles wide, which falls from the mountain on the
east side of the valley about 120 feet perpendicular into which creek
three other fine streams empty, the second creek is the principal
supply of the Cayuga Lake navigable for large canoes or boats to the
town.</p>

<p>Sept. 20, 1779.&mdash;I return to the 20th to follow Col. Butler, who left
us at Kanadasago, and proceeded along the outlet of Seneca Lake for 8
miles and halted at Schoyerre, formerly destroyed by Col. Harper.</p>

<p>Sept. 21.&mdash;Early this morning a party of 200 men under the command of
Maj. Scott was despatched to destroy corn, &amp;c., the remainder with
Col. Butler, proceeded on forward. Seven miles of the road was very
bad, the land poor and barren, and no water. They then entered on an
excellent swamp which produces fine timber, the soil exceeding rich
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>and fertile. This extends for 4 miles, when they reached Caiuga Lake.
This they crossed at a place wading it to their breasts in water,
where they halted waiting for Maj. Scott and his party. As soon as
they had joined, they proceeded along the side of the lake side, the
land excellent, the timber large and the country level and well
watered. Came to a habitation within one mile of Caiuga town and
encamped 18 miles from Scoyerre.</p>

<p>Sept. 22.&mdash;Marched to Caiuga<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> one mile distant. This town is large
and commodius, consisting of 50 houses mostly well built. The party
went immediately to destroying corn, &amp;c., with which this place
abounds, but the water very bad and scarce. Here was found some salt
of the Indians making from the Salt Springs<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> which are in this
country. Found several muskets here, branded with the brand of the
United States; also a few Regimental coats, blue, faced with white.</p>

<p>Sept. 23.&mdash;The most part of the day taken up in destroying scattering
towns, corn, &amp;c., within 2 or 3 miles all around this town. About 4
o'clock marched for another town<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> distant 4 miles but could not
learn any name for it, and here halted for the night.</p>

<p>Sept. 24.&mdash;This morning went to destroying corn, beans, and orchards.
Destroyed about 1500 Peach Trees, besides apple trees and other fruit
trees. This town consisted of 13 <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>houses. Then marched for 18 miles,
the first 12 the land exceeding good, the other six not extraordinary.</p>

<p>Sept. 25.&mdash;Marched for 10-&frac12; miles the road mostly bad, having to
ascend and descend extreme steep and difficult mountains, then through
thick and difficult swamps. Passed the end of Caiuga Lake and halted
at De-ho-riss-kana-dia<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> which they found burnt and the corn partly
destroyed. Here was found the Rev. Dr. Kirkland's horse, supposed to
be left here by the party who destroyed the corn, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sept. 26.&mdash;Marched for 8-&frac12; miles through the Great Swamp.</p>

<p>Sept. 27.&mdash;Marched for 17 miles, 15 of which was through the above
swamp. Most part of the way, they had to steer by the sun, there not
being the least semblance of a road or path. A man of this party died
suddenly.</p>

<p>Sept. 28.&mdash;Marched for one mile and crossed the outlet (inlet) of
Caiuga Lake, and came upon ground occupied by the army on the night of
the 31st of August, from there to Kanawaholee,<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> where they joined
the main body of Sullivan's army.</p>

<h3>MARCH OF COLONEL DEARBORN ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF CAYUGA LAKE.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>On the return march, after crossing the outlet of Seneca Lake east of
Kanadaseaga, the army encamped on the high ground at Rose Hill, near
the east shore of the lake. Here Lieutenant Colonel Henry Dearborn
commanding the Third New Hampshire regiment, was detached with two
hundred men and ordered to march along the west shore of Cayuga lake
to co-operate with Colonel Butler in devastating the country of the
Cayugas.</p>

<p>Colonel Dearborn was born in Hampton, N.H., in March, 1751. He was a
captain at Bunker Hill, and accompanied Arnold in the march through
the woods against Quebec, in which expedition he was captured. He was
exchanged in 1777, and soon after was appointed Major of Scammel's
regiment. At Saratoga he commanded a separate battalion under General
Gates, and was afterwards at Monmouth, where he distinguished himself
and the regiment by a gallant charge. In 1779 Colonel Scammel was
acting as Adjutant General of the army, leaving Lieut. Colonel
Dearborn in command of the regiment during Sullivan's campaign. He was
at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, and afterward on garrison duty at
Saratoga and West Point until 1784. He served two terms in Congress,
was for eight years secretary of war under Jefferson, and in the war
of 1812 was senior Major General of the army. In 1822 he was minister
to Portugal, from whence he returned after two years' service, and
died in Roxbury, Mass., June 6, 1829. After his death, his son, Henry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Alexander Scammel Dearborn, collected and arranged the valuable papers
of his father, transcribed the journals, which extended through the
entire period of the revolution, and added important historical
sketches, the whole making forty-five large volumes handsomely bound
in morocco, the exterior approximating in elegance to the inestimable
value of the material within. On the death of the son, all of these,
excepting seven volumes, were taken apart, and the contents, made up
of valuable autograph letters of the revolutionary period, scattered
to the four winds by a sale at public auction. The original manuscript
Journal of Sullivan's campaign fell into the hands of Dr. John H.S.
Fogg, of Boston. The manuscript Orderly Book of Valley Forge, was
purchased by John H. Osborne, Esq., of Auburn. The seven volumes,
containing no autographs, were reserved at the sale and remain intact
In one of these is the Journal kept during Sullivan's campaign, as
transcribed by the son, of which the following is an extract:</p>

<br />

<h3 class="sc">Part of Colonel Dearborn's Journal, 1779.</h3>

<p>Sept. 21.&mdash;I was ordered with 200 men to proceed to the west side of
the Cayuga Lake, from thence down the side of the lake to the south
end, to burn and destroy such houses and corn as might be found and to
intercept the Cayugas if they attempted to escape Col. Butler. At 8
o'clock I marched, proceeded an east course about 8 miles and found 3
wigwams in the woods<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> with some small patches of corn, squashes,
water-melons and cucumbers and 15 horses which we could not take.
Destroyed this village, proceeded 4 miles to the lake where we found a
very pretty town of 10 <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>houses<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and a considerable quantity of
corn, all which we burnt. We discovered another small town about a
mile above this, we likewise destroyed. This place is called
Skannautenate.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> After destroying this town I marched on one mile,
and came to a new town<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> consisting of 9 houses which we destroyed,
and proceeded one mile and found one large house which we set fire to,
and marched 2 miles and encamped. The land we marched over this day is
exceeding fine.</p>

<p>Sept. 22.&mdash;I marched &frac12; an hour before sunrise, proceeded 5 miles and
came to the ruins of a town which a part of our army burnt when it was
advancing who missed their way and happened to fall in with it, &frac12; a
mile distant found a large field of corn and 3 houses. We gathered the
corn and burnt it in the houses. This town is called Swahyawana.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
Moved on 5 miles and came to a wigwam with 3 squaws and one young
Indian who was a cripple. I took 2 of the squaws who were about 40
years of age and marched on 3 miles and found 1 hut and a field of
corn which was burnt. Went 4 miles further and encamped.</p>

<p>Sept. 23.&mdash;Marched at sunrise, proceeded without any path or track, or
any person who was ever in this part of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>country before to guide
us, and the land so horribly rough and brushy that it was difficult to
advance, however with great labor and difficulty we proceeded 8 miles
to the end of a long cape<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> which I expected was the end of the
lake. We then marched off 2 or 3 miles from the lake, and went by a
point of compass 8 miles to the end of the lake and encamped. This
lake is 40 miles in length and from 2 to 5 miles in width, and runs
nearly No. and So. parallel to the Seneca lake which is from 8 to 10
miles distant.</p>

<p>Sept. 24.&mdash;Marched at sunrise, proceeded 3 miles on the high land and
came to an old path which led us to 2 huts and some cornfields, which
we burnt. I then sent several parties in different directions to look
for a large town that I had been informed was not many miles from the
end of the lake. The parties found 10 or 12 scattering houses and a
number of large cornfields on and near the stream that falls into the
lake. After burning several fields of corn and houses they discovered
the town, 3 miles from the lake, on the above mentioned stream, which
contained 25 houses and is called Coreorgonel<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and is the capital
of a small nation or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>tribe. My party was employed from 9 till sunset
in destroying the town and corn. I expected to have met Col. Butler
with his party at this town.</p>

<p>Sept. 25.&mdash;Marched at sunrise for Catherine's Town, where I was
ordered to join the main army. Proceeded a due west <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>course over a
very rough, mountainous country 18 miles, and at 4 o'clock reached the
town, but the army was gone forward. Advanced 6 miles in what is
called the Bear Swamp and encamped.</p>

<p>Sept. 26.&mdash;Marched at sunrise and at 12 o'clock joined the main army
at Kanawalahola which is 4 miles from where we fought the enemy on the
29th of August. The army had a day of rejoicing here in consequence
from the news of Spain.</p>

<p>Sept. 27.&mdash;Some detachments were sent up the Teago river to destroy
such houses and corn fields as they might find.</p>

<p>Sept. 28.&mdash;The same parties that were sent out yesterday were sent
again further up the river to destroy a Tory settlement which was
discovered yesterday, and a large detachment was sent off to complete
the destruction of the corn, &amp;c., at and about New Town. At 12 o'clock
Col. Butler and his party arrived in Camp. In their route round the
lake they destroyed several towns and a vast quantity of corn.</p>

Point. The bank of the lake both north and south of this, is very much
cut up with ravines, and the lake shore is too rocky and precipitous
for an Indian path. For several miles the trail was back two miles
from the lake, along the heads of the ravines, probably passing
through Hayt's corners and Ovid Centre. From this high ground the lake
appears to end at Taghanic Point.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p class="noin"><a name="Footnote_161_161" id="Footnote_161_161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_161_161"><span class="label">[161]</span></a> <span class="sc">Coreorgonel</span>, called De-ho-riss-kanadia by
George Grant, was located on the west side of Cayuga inlet, about
three miles from the end of the lake, and two miles south of Ithaca.
The main village was on a high ground south of the school-house on the
farm of James Fleming, nearly opposite Buttermilk Falls. Several
skeletons have been exhumed here within a few years, and the usual
variety of relics found, such as hatchets, wampum, beads, &amp;c. A
solitary apple-tree still remains, a fit memento to represent the race
by which it was planted. When first known to the whites there were
five boles starting from the ground, but these are now reduced to two,
and are probably shoots from the original tree cut down or girdled by
Dearborn. The town was destroyed September 24, 1779. At this time it
contained twenty-five houses, besides ten or twelve scattered between
the main village and the lake. Colonel Butler after passing up on the
east side of Cayuga Lake halted here on the 25th, and found Rev. Dr.
Kirkland's horse in the vicinity of the smoking ruins.</p>

<p class="noin">A peculiar interest is attached to this locality and village, from the
fact that here the representatives of a once powerful people, sought
to preserve for a brief period, the last remaining spark of a council
fire that from time immemorial had burned brilliantly in the presence
of assembled nations, numbering their warriors by thousands. They were
called by the Iroquois <span class="sc">Toderichroones</span>, one of the tribes
known to the English as Catawbas, sometimes called Saponies. They
formerly resided between the Potomac and Roanoke rivers, east of the
Alleghanies. A most inveterate hostile feeling existed between them
and the Iroquois, which reached back to near the middle of the
seventeenth century. A peace was arranged as early as 1685, through
negotiations with the government of Virginia, and again what was
expected to be a "lasting peace" and firm alliance, was concluded in
1714, but in the night after the close of the council, the Iroquois
deputies, while reposing in fancied security were treacherously
murdered while asleep. This aroused the Iroquois to vengeance, and the
war was renewed with unexampled ferocity, with a determination to
totally extirpate the base, faithless and treacherous people. In 1717
through the intercession of Governor Hunter, at the request of
Governor Spottswood of Virginia, a truce was arranged, and in 1722
delegates from the Five Nations met Governor Spottswood at Albany to
conclude what was to be an "everlasting peace," in which the Iroquois
bound themselves not to cross the Potomac or go over the Alleghanies,
without a passport from the Governor of New York, Governor Spottswood
engaging that the tribes in his locality should not pass to the north
or west of same lines. The tribes mentioned by the Governor were the
"<span class="sc">Nottoways, Meherins, Nansemonds,
Pamunkeys, Chicohominys</span>, and the <span class="sc">Christanna
Indians</span> whom you call <span class="sc">Toderichroones</span>," and others&mdash;in
all, ten nations. This council was conducted with great formality, and
valuable presents were presented, among which were a "<i>fine coronet</i>"
and a "<i>gold horse shoe</i>" with an inscription. In 1738 they were again
at war, and in 1742 at peace. In 1731 Governor Clinton says "the
Governor of South Carolina sent six chiefs of the Catawbas, to make
peace with the Five Nations," and says that "they had been at war as
long as any one in this country can remember." In 1753 Sir William
Johnson mentions the fact that the Cayugas "<i>are about to strengthen
their castle by taking in the</i> <span class="sc">Tedarighroones</span>." In the same
year they are mentioned as attending a conference at Mt. Johnson and
are described as "one of the nine confederate nations." The town is
indicated at the head of Cayuga lake on the Guy Johnson map of 1771,
in the same position where it was found by Colonel Dearborn in 1779,
under the name of <span class="sc">Todevighrono</span>, the name of the people. In
1750 Zeisberger, the Moravian missionary, passed through this valley
while on his way to visit the Cayugas, but makes no mention of an
Indian village in the vicinity. Undoubtedly they settled there in the
summer of 1753. Their cleared fields were found on the present site of
Ithaca on the first settlement of the country by the whites and were
the first lands occupied in the county. The town is indicated but not
named on the map of Mr. Lodge, the surveyor who accompanied Colonel
Butler's detachment. To stand on the identical spot from which this
people sunk into oblivion, appeared like standing on the grave of a
nation. Their history, the beginning of which extends far back into
the unknown and unattainable, ends where that of civilization begins,
and adds another name to the long list of extinguished nationalities
that preceded us in sovereignty. Here their council fire, fanned by
the last expiring breath of a once brave and numerous people, was
extinguished forever.</p></div>

Hurley, Ulster County, New York. In 1776 he was serving as Second
Lieutenant in Colonel Ritzema's 3d New York Regiment, organized to
garrison the forts southward of Crown Point. Under the call of
September 16, 1776, he entered the Second New York Regiment <i>to serve
during the war</i>, and continued with that regiment as Lieutenant and
Captain until the consolidation of the five New York regiments into
two in December, 1780, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>when he was assigned to the class of deranged
officers, and continued in service to the close of the war. He
afterward settled at Palatine Church, in the Mohawk Valley, where he
died greatly respected in November, 1822.</p>


<div class="block2"><p>This Journal has had a somewhat interesting history. A portion
of it appeared in 1831 in Campbell's Annals of Tryon County, as
"extracts from the manuscript Journal of an officer," but
without giving the author's name. Extracts have also appeared
from time to time in the writings of the late Thomas Maxwell of
Elmira, as the Journal of Colonel Gansevoort. In Colonel
Stone's Life of Brant, 1838, Introduction p. xxiii, he says
"the author has likewise been favored with the manuscript diary
of the venerable Captain Theodosius Fowler of this city, who
was an active officer during the whole campaign. In addition to
the valuable memoranda contained in this diary, Capt. Fowler
has preserved a drawing of the Order of March *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and a plan
of the <i>great battle fought at Newtown</i>, both of which drawings
have been engraved, and will be found in the Appendix." In the
body of the work he incorporates the text as found in
Campbell's Annals, including several interpolations from
Seaver's Life of Mary Jemison, which appear in the Annals <i>as
quoted</i>, but in Colonel Stone's work as <i>part of the original
Journal</i>. At page 18, Vol. II. appears the "Order of March" and
"Order of Battle," the latter having no reference whatever to
the battle of Newtown, it being nothing more than the general
order of battle prescribed at the beginning of the campaign.
After the death of Colonel Stone, the original manuscript fell
into the hands of that distinguished scholar, Dr. Lyman C.
Draper, Secretary of Wisconsin Historical Society, who
purchased it at the sale in a bound volume of manuscripts. In
June, 1879, he placed it in my hands for examination and
directed my attention to the fact, of its unquestionable
identity with the many fragments ascribed to Captain Fowler and
others. The Journal is substantially a history of the movements
of the Second regiment from the date of the first entry to the
time of the consolidation in 1780, when it closes. It contains
abundant evidence to warrant the conclusion that it must have
been written by an officer of that regiment. This appears
effectually to dispose of the claims of the supposed authorship
of Captain Fowler, as he was made Captain of the First New York
June 21, 1778, and continued in service with that regiment
until the consolidation 1780, when he was assigned to the new
New York Second, and continued in that position to the close of
the war. It is highly probable that Captain Fowler was on duty
with his regiment, which remained to guard the Mohawk Valley
during Sullivan's campaign, and consequently could not have
participated in the westward march, and if the author of a
Journal it certainly cannot be the one in question, which
beyond any doubt was written by an officer actively engaged in
the main expedition. A careful examination of the manuscript
disclosed the fact that unmistakably it is the hand writing of
Captain Nukerck, and presumably his Journal. On being advised
of this fact Dr. Draper addressed a note to Mrs. Miller, of
Englewood, N.J., a granddaughter of Captain Nukerck, who
answered "that she remembered distinctly, that her father
loaned to Mr. Campbell the Diary of her grandfather relating to
Sullivan's Campaign, and that afterward it was loaned to an
agent of Colonel Stone, who failed to return it." The
manuscript is in an excellent state of preservation, every word
from beginning to end being plain and distinct, especially the
proper names. It contains several maps indicating the line of
march and encampments, and at the end a single leaf is missing,
probably the order of march and order of battle, mentioned by
Colonel Stone.</p></div>

extends north of Tioga Point and west as far as Kanadaseaga.</p>

of General Washington; General Sullivan's Official Reports; many
valuable letters from General James Clinton; and undoubtedly many
journals will be added to those already known, now that the attention
of the public has been directed to the revolutionary period, and
especially to the Campaign of 1779.</p>
